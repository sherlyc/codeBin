Components Contracts
A contract defines the expected behavior of your component and what assumptions are reasonable to have about its usage. 

To find your component’s contract, ask yourself questions like:
What does my component render?
Does my component render different things under different circumstances?
When I pass a function as a prop, what does my component use it for?Does it call it, or just give it to another component? If it calls it, what does it call it with?
When the user interacts with my component, what happens?

What is worth testing?
Will the test have to duplicate exactly the application code? This will make it brittle.
Will making assertions in the test duplicate any behavior that is already covered by (and the responsibility of) library code?
From an outsider’s perspective, is this detail important, or is it only an internal concern? Can the effect of this internal detail be described using only the component’s public API?
